# Kotlin Backend

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* You need to have java installed on your system. You can get the Java from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

* You also need to have MongoDB installed. Just download it as normal from [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) or if you like using docker like me, pull mongodb from [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) then run:
    ```
    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 -v ~/data:/data/db mongo
    ```

* And sure you need an IDE. For me, the best one is [intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment
